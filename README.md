# ApplyForceOnFace
I made an ACT extension for applying force on a face. In fact, I scripted the already existed "Force" that Ansys provides, from scratch. 
The user defines the force either by components or by vector. Also, he chooses a desired coordinate system and force's direction.


I wrote this program due to my internship in Simtec Software and Services.
